# Steps II

6. Click on "Continue to checkout".

7. Fill in the required information and click "Continue". You must use your real email and phone number since you will get an activation link + code. 

If you get the chance, then select "I want one.com to administrate my *** domains." 

In your case it means that when you wish to terminate the domain you allow one.com to do it on your behalf rather than you having to contact another company to do it.

Take a break! It can take up to an hour before you get the domain.
